	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		aside·eth is a time-lock protocol for the contemporary digital art world, based on the
		collaboration of the distributed gallery, the <a href="https://verse.works" target="_blank"
			>verse marketplace</a
		>
		and various digital artists.
	</p>
	<p>
		Aside is a protocol that enables the immobilization of any NFT on the Ethereum blockchain and
		conditions its release to external phenomena, whether natural, astral, economic, demographic, or
		social. Once time-locked, the artwork remains non-transferable for a dedicated period or until
		the occurrence of a specific real-world event, therefore restricting the tradability of the NFTs
		by tying its commercial becoming to the outside world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Aside is about extracting an NFT from market mechanisms. It is about restoring a stillness
		outside the flow of exchange. It is about reclaiming a presence subtracted from its economic
		specters: aside from markets, aside from speculation, aside from value.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through this protocol, we aim to introduce a fresh perspective on digital artworks, ushering in
		a new era in the realm of crypto-art. Aside is a strings game where work of art are putting away
		from market forces for a given period and in certain knottiness with non-human things. Because
		with our protocol the merchandise future of an artwork is caught in the net of the outside world
		we hope to open up a new way of looking at the digital art and the off-chain realities in which
		they are embedded.
	</p>
	<h1>Aside and the flesh of the World</h1>
	<p>
		Aside aims to act as the stitching point between phenomena that are ordinarily separated by
		linking artworks liquidity to natural, economic, astral, or social events through the use of
		oracles. Thanks to oracle technologies the economic life cycle of artworks and the world's life
		become truly interdependent.
	</p>
	<p>
		With Aside, the trading possibilities of an artwork are closely linked to the state of a natural
		resource (forest, fishery), the economic situation of a country (inflation, deflation), the
		evolution of financial asset (stock market), meteorological conditions in a given location,
		astral phenomena (solar eruption, planetary transit) observable from Earth, or the emergence of
		natural disasters (earthquake, storm).
	</p>
	<p>
		Aside aim to drastically alter the experience of possession by inoculating in it a consonant
		relationship with off chain realities. A troubled experience of possession emerges because it is
		the more-than-human who is first and foremost the very owner of the work, the more-than-human
		that animates and haunts both the artwork and the owner.
	</p>

	<h1>Roadmap</h1>
	<p>
		Starting from **May 2024 and ending in May 2025**, we will publish and sell, during **the first
		week of each month** on The Verse, a series of artworks by an artist who uses Aside to **remove
		his/her work from the market by conditioning its potential release on a specific phenomenon**.
		This will showcase, month after month, the potential applications of the Aside protocol.
	</p>
	<p>
		Physical exhibitions of these works will take place in several institutions throughout the
		United States and Europe.
